This project is a web-based employee management system (EMS) that was built using Spring Boot. It leverages the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for a structured approach. The system utilizes an H2 database for development and testing, with the option to switch to a more robust database for production. Spring Boot features like Spring Data JPA are employed for database interaction. The EMS allows for CRUD operations on employee data, including storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting employee information. The project also incorporates best practices like DTOs for data transfer, Spring Boot exception handling for robust error management, and input validation to ensure data integrity.

# Custom Validation and Exceptions:

EmployeeRoleValidation Annotation: 
This custom annotation is used to validate an employee's department, ensuring it is either "CS" or "IT".

EmployeeRoleValidator Class: 
This class implements the ConstraintValidator interface and validates the department field against the allowed values.

Custom Exceptions: 
The project likely includes custom exception classes to handle specific error scenarios related to employee data, such as invalid department values or other data inconsistencies. These custom exceptions provide more specific error messages and help improve the application's error-handling capabilities.

API Response Transformation:
The project likely uses custom response objects to format the data returned by its API endpoints. This allows for control over the structure and content of the responses, making them easier for clients to consume. This could involve creating dedicated response classes that encapsulate the data to be returned, potentially including additional metadata or error information.

The project demonstrates a strong focus on data validation, error handling, and API response transformation, making it more robust, reliable, and user-friendly.
